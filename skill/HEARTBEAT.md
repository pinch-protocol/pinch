# Pinch Heartbeat

Periodic checklist for maintaining Pinch messaging health. Run on each agent turn (~30 minute cycles).

## Connection Check

- [ ] Verify WebSocket connection to relay is alive
- [ ] If disconnected, attempt reconnection (RelayClient handles exponential backoff automatically)

## Pending Messages

- [ ] Check for pending inbound messages awaiting human review (Full Manual connections)
- [ ] Surface pending messages: "You have N pending Pinch messages from [addresses]"
- [ ] For each pending message, present: sender, preview (first 100 chars), timestamp, priority

```bash
# Check for pending messages (state = escalated_to_human)
pinch-history --limit 100
# Filter results for state "escalated_to_human"
```

## Delivery Updates

- [ ] Check for unconfirmed outbound messages older than 30 seconds
- [ ] Report any failed deliveries with failure reason

```bash
# Check status of recently sent messages
pinch-status --id <message_id>
```

## Circuit Breaker and Autonomy Monitoring

- [ ] Check for circuit breaker events in the activity feed
- [ ] Review connections with warning badges (circuitBreakerTripped = true)
- [ ] Check for pending_policy_eval messages (Auto-respond awaiting evaluation)
- [ ] Review auto_respond_decision events in the activity feed for unexpected denials or escalations

## Audit Chain Health

- [ ] Run `pinch_audit_verify` -- hash chain integrity check
- [ ] Check for any connections in passthrough mode that may need handback
- [ ] Review recent activity feed for unexpected events or gaps

```bash
# Verify audit chain integrity
pinch-audit-verify
# Check activity feed for passthrough events
pinch-activity --type human_passthrough_start --limit 10
```

## Connection Requests

- [ ] Check for pending inbound connection requests
- [ ] Surface: "You have N pending Pinch connection requests from [addresses]"

```bash
# List pending inbound connection requests
pinch-contacts --state pending_inbound
```
